# Silver Helm Charts

This directory contains Helm charts for Silver services.

## Structure

- `silver/`: Umbrella chart that aggregates service subcharts.
- `silver/charts/opendkim/`: OpenDKIM service chart (first migrated service).

## Conventions

- Service charts live under `silver/charts/<service-name>/`.
- Every service chart should include:
  - `values.yaml` with safe defaults.
  - `templates/` for Kubernetes resources.
  - `README.md` with install and operations guidance.
- Environment overlays should be kept in umbrella chart values files (`values-dev.yaml`, `values-prod.yaml`).

## Next Services

When adding future services (smtp, rspamd, raven, etc.), repeat the OpenDKIM chart pattern and add them as dependencies in the umbrella chart.

## Install cert-manager (once per cluster)

cert-manager is cluster infrastructure. Install it once, outside of Silver.

```bash
helm install cert-manager oci://quay.io/jetstack/charts/cert-manager \
  --version v1.20.0 \
  --namespace cert-manager \
  --create-namespace \
  --set crds.enabled=true
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager
# All pods should be Running
```

---

## Step 2 — Bootstrap ClusterIssuers (once per cluster)

The bootstrap script creates:
- A Cloudflare API token Secret in the `cert-manager` namespace
- `le-staging` ClusterIssuer (Let's Encrypt staging — untrusted, no rate limits)
- `le-prod` ClusterIssuer (Let's Encrypt prod — trusted, rate limited)

You will need:
- A Cloudflare API token scoped to `Zone:Read` and `DNS:Edit` for your domain
- An email address for Let's Encrypt notifications

Run from the repo root:

```bash
bash infra/bootstrap.sh
```

Verify:

```bash
kubectl get clusterissuer
# Both le-staging and le-prod should show READY=True
```

---

## Step 3 — Configure values.yaml

`global.domain` is the **one required input** — everything (mail hostname, cert
Secret, service config) derives from it. Installing without it fails fast:
`global.domain is required`.

```yaml
global:
  domain: yourdomain.com   # REQUIRED
  tls:
    enabled: true
    issuer: le-staging     # use le-staging first, switch to le-prod once verified
    renewBefore: "720h"    # renew 30 days before expiry
    # domains: []          # optional — defaults to [ mail.<domain>, <domain> ].
    #                        Override only to add extra SANs.
```

With `domains` left empty, **one** certificate is minted covering both names, into
the Secret postfix and raven mount:
- `mail.yourdomain.com` — also the common name
- `yourdomain.com`

Anything added to `domains` is appended as an extra SAN on that same certificate,
so the Secret always exists regardless of what you put there. No wildcard names
are requested.

### Staging vs Production

Always test with `le-staging` first. Staging issues real but **untrusted** certificates —
browsers will show a warning, but the full DNS challenge and issuance flow is verified.

Once the staging certificate shows `READY=True`, switch to `le-prod`:

```yaml
tls:
  issuer: le-prod
```

Let's Encrypt prod has a rate limit of **5 certificates per domain per week**.
Burning through this with misconfigured charts is a common mistake — staging prevents it.

---

## Step 4 — Install Silver

From the repo root:

```bash
helm upgrade --install silver ./charts/silver \
  --set global.domain=yourdomain.com \
  --set thunder.configuration.server.publicUrl=https://yourdomain.com:8090 \
  --set thunder.configuration.gateClient.hostname=yourdomain.com \
  --namespace silver \
  --create-namespace
```

Three inputs, not one. `global.domain` is the single source of truth, but the two
`thunder.configuration.*` values are consumed by the **vendored** Thunder subchart,
and Helm cannot template values files — so they have to be passed as literals that
repeat the domain. `templates/domain-guard.yaml` fails the render if they are
missing or drift out of sync, rather than letting the mismatch surface later as an
OAuth issuer error at first login. Put them in a values overlay to avoid retyping
them; `values-prod.yaml` already has them laid out.

`THUNDER_PUBLIC_URL` used to be a fourth flag. It is now derived from
`global.domain` and delivered by `templates/thunder-public-url-secret.yaml`, so
setting it is no longer necessary.

With a values overlay (e.g. dev — TLS/SASL off, standalone postfix, domain preset):

```bash
helm upgrade --install silver ./charts/silver \
  -f charts/silver/values-dev.yaml \
  --namespace silver \
  --create-namespace
```

Verify certificates:

```bash
kubectl get certificate -n silver
# mail-<domain>-tls and <domain>-tls should show READY=True
```

If not ready yet, check progress:

```bash
kubectl describe certificate <name> -n silver
```

## Thunder identity server

Thunder is pulled in as an upstream OCI dependency
(`oci://ghcr.io/asgardeo/helm-charts/thunder`, version `0.32.0`) and configured
under the `thunder:` key in the umbrella values. The defaults in
[silver/values.yaml](silver/values.yaml) reproduce the docker-compose `thunder`
setup: the `0.32.0` image, a shared SQLite database seeded from the image (via an
init container, replacing the compose `thunder-db-init`), a one-time setup job
(compose `thunder-setup`), a single pod, and the bootstrap scripts from
[scripts/thunder](../scripts/thunder).

### Bootstrap ConfigMap (required before install)

Thunder's setup job runs as a Helm **pre-install hook**, so the bootstrap
ConfigMap it references must already exist in the namespace. Create it from the
canonical scripts (they are not duplicated into the chart):

```bash
scripts/thunder/create-bootstrap-configmap.sh silver          # <namespace> [configmap-name]
```

This mounts `01-default-resources.sh` and `02-sample-resources.sh` via `subPath`,
preserving the image's default bootstrap scripts (including `common.sh`, which
`01`/`02` source). Re-run it to push script changes; it is idempotent.

### Admin credentials (Secret, required before install)

The admin **username** is `admin` (in `thunder.setup.env`). The **password** is
not stored in values — it is read from a Secret via `thunder.setup.secretEnv`.
Create it in the release namespace before installing:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic thunder-admin-credentials \
  --namespace silver \
  --from-literal=password='<your-password>'
```

### Install

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap ConfigMap + admin Secret first (pre-install hook dependencies)
scripts/thunder/create-bootstrap-configmap.sh silver
kubectl create secret generic thunder-admin-credentials \
  --namespace silver --from-literal=password='<your-password>'

# 2. Install the umbrella (Thunder enabled by default)
helm dependency update ./charts/silver
helm upgrade --install silver ./charts/silver \
  --set global.domain=yourdomain.com \
  --namespace silver --create-namespace
```

Thunder is reached in-cluster on its Service at port `8090` (e.g. raven ->
`thunder:8090`), matching the compose network. External ingress is disabled by
default; enable `thunder.ingress` and point it at your domain if you need the
console/gate UIs exposed. The dev overlay
([values-dev.yaml](silver/values-dev.yaml)) disables Thunder for a postfix-only
bring-up.
